# Assets

The assets folder is the location for static assets.

The bootstrap-theme-dist folder contains a frozen/embedded version of the [BC Gov Bootstrap Theme](https://bcgov.github.io/bootstrap-theme/) for Bootstrap 4.3.1. When this was added there was no version successfully available through npm installation that would respect web-fonts.
