DevOps Process
-------------

### Jenkins

If any pipeline steps do not start, a common root cause is issues with Jenkins.  Restart the Jenkins service by scaling it down to 0 pods, then back up to 1 pod.

### DEV builds
Dev builds are triggered by source code being committed to the repository.  This process triggers a webhook which initiates the DEV build pipeline.

## Promotion to TEST
Login to the OpenShift Web Console and navigate to the Tools project for the system.  Go to Builds->Pipelines.  Click  Start Pipeline on the Test Pipeline.

## Promotion to PROD
Login to the OpenShift Web Console and navigate to the Tools project for the system.  Go to Builds->Pipelines.  Click  Start Pipeline on the Prod Pipeline.
